# ðŸ§  ReadWriteRun

Welcome to **ReadWriteRun**, a structured, hands-on repository where I dive deep into impactful machine learning research papers â€” not just to read, but to **rebuild, understand, and apply** them.

This project has three core tracks:
- **Applications**: End-to-end implementations of applied research papers
- **Architectures**: Recreating foundational models from scratch or with libraries like PyTorch
- **Blog Experiments**: Reproducing and extending interesting blog posts and code walkthroughs
